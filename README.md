# library
planning to put explanations below (English and Japanese) \
https://sqrtnull.github.io/cp-library/

## How to Use

1. Create working folder to code in
```
mkdir cpp
cd cpp
```
2. Clone this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/sqrtnull/cp-library.git
```
3. Copy `Utility/include.sh` to working folder and change `lib_path` accordingly
```
cp cp-library/Utility/include.sh include.sh
```
4. Copy `Utility/template.cpp` to working folder as `main.cpp`
```
cp cp-library/Utility/template.cpp main.cpp
```
5. Allow execution for `include.sh`
```
chmod +x include.sh
```
6. Try including the code of a library into `main.cpp`. (don't forget to save before!)
```
./include.sh SegmentTree
```

Note: I might include my other commands sometime in the future
