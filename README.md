# library
planning to put explanations below (English and Japanese) \
https://sqrtnull.github.io/cp-library/

## How to Use

1. Create working folder to code in

2. Clone this repo

3. copy Utility/include.sh to working folder and change lib\_path accordingly

4. copy Utility/template.cpp to working folder as main.cpp

5. chmod +x include.sh to allow execution

6. ./include.sh LIB\_NAME to include the code of a library into main.cpp. example:./include.sh SegmentTree (don't forget to save before!)

Note: I might include my other commands sometime in the future
