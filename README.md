# library
planning to put explanations below (English and Japanese) \
https://sqrtnull.github.io/cp-library/

## How to Use

1. Create working folder to code in
```
mkdir cpp
cd cpp
```
2. Clone this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/sqrtnull/cp-library.git
```
3. copy Utility/include.sh to working folder and change lib\_path accordingly
```
cp cp-library/Utility/include.sh include.sh
```
4. copy Utility/template.cpp to working folder as main.cpp
```
cp cp-library/Utility/template.cpp main.cpp
```
5. chmod +x include.sh to allow execution
```
chmod +x include.sh
```
6. ./include.sh LIB\_NAME to include the code of a library into main.cpp. example:./include.sh SegmentTree (don't forget to save before!)
```
./include.sh SegmentTree
```

Note: I might include my other commands sometime in the future
